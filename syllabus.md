# Syllabus

## Intro
* me, my background, what I do, my contact info
* links online resources
  - the lesson repo
  - libguide

## Learning Goals

By the end of the workshop, participants should be able to:

* describe and apply principles for organizing and naming files and folders
* employ the concept of tidy data for structuring tabular data
* import and view tabular data in R

The goal is to give you practical advice, that will continue to pay off as your projects get more complex, you work on more projects, you develop collaborations.

## Motivations

* organize your projects and your data for:
  - reproducibility
  - make the work more accessible for others and yourself (i.e. when you return to it after working on something else)
  - We do not want to get in the way of the creative process
  
## File and Folder Organization

* You don't want to spend time figuring out where files are, or which is the latest version
* Using a general system builds up habits for storing and finding things
* Example
  - types of folders I have
  - project organization (see also Marwick et al. 2018 for examples with varying complexity)
  
## Naming 

* sounds simple, but doing so well matters a great deal
* principles
  - machine readable
  - human readable
  - plays well with default ordering
* machine-readable
  - avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, different cases
  - use underscore "_" to separate levels of organization
  - use hyphen "-" to separate words within a level
* human-readable
  - use names that will help you find it later
  - use nouns for objects, use verbs for actions
* plays well with default ordering
  - files are ordered alphabetically by default -- use it!
  - left-pad with numbers to order steps in sequence
  - use ISO-8601 for dates

## Tidy Data

* tidy data and formatting
  - Excel date conversion
  - don't use formatting to store information
  - data validation can save time on 

* 

## Importing Data
